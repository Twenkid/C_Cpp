The solution so far was a "thunk" (trampoline), but that was considered a hack and not good enough: https://pastebin.com/yQ3skPsi

The callbacks are like:

```
long (*asioMessage) (long selector, long value, void* message, double* opt);
```

They are registered in the Steinberg ASIO C-API (Windows OS). However these callbacks can't receive a context and "this" can't be sent, while the callbacks should be called in the context of different instances - thus a global scope variable can't be used. The callbacks also have to be called from different threads - i.e. they can't be run in a separate thread and sent using thread local storage.

The only solution so far is to use a dynamically generated code which pushes instructions in an array, marks the page as Executable and casts it to the callback function type.



**Do you have better ideas?**

* If it's open source, add the parameter?

Third-party proprietary drivers are used, so that parameter can't be refactored.

* What about the function ASIOFuture which takes userdata?

  ASIOFuture() is called by the host, the driver has to implement it. That user data is interpreted by the specific drivers. The driver invokes the callbacks wherever it decides, that's where I want to know the callback of which of my instances is invoked.


* Would std::bind solve the problem?

No, because it also returns an object. (A confusing association with bind applied for boost:asio)


* Why not making a wrapper?

 It is unknown how to send an instance to the wrapper.


* What about C++ closures? 

You can cast to a function pointer only simple lambdas which do not close a context, i.e. [](...){..}

* What about running processes, instead of threads, with a main process which controls them through Pipes or FileMapping? There's also a WM_COPYDATA message which allow sending void* in the main windows message loop [for control between the processes]?

* Idea from another group: during the registration of the callbacks, the user receives unique pointers to buffers; they could be used as keys in a map for finding "this".

However the performance would suffer and it wouldn't be a straight forward solution... 
It won't work, because these buffers are not received in the callbacks.

* Each time create a new function with a new address with a bit of Assembly and you're "back in business". A few instructions to call the original callback with a context that's hardcoded.

  Yes, that was the solution so far: an array in the dynamic memory, marked as Executable (in order to avoid the DEP protection, data execution protection). Then "this" and minimal code, which collects the parameters, is saved in the array. The machine code takes "this" as an offset from the program counter and calls the target callback. The array is cast to the type of the original callback, and it is sent to the driver, instead of a normal callback function.
  
* If you need a finite number of callback functions, you can make a static pool and each of these functions to be a bind-ing of a context and call of a common function.

* The specs PDF has a global instance, to which you can submit a callback for calling. It even has user data. Even if you have user data, though, if it's one callback with one global source, how exactly would you use it?

The Windows API is COM-based and references to different COM objects can be retrieved, it is supported by most of the drivers. It works for sure if it's for different DLLs.

* Why not give them different functions? You haven't given enough information. It is possible that the only solution is to inject code around the call site of the callback. It is highly probable that, due to the specific requirements, to have a standard alternative solution, which does not depend on the platform and the architecture. Can you create a minimal example which can allow us to try out this library - a code which illustrates how the source [in the data interaction context] is instantiated and how it calls the callback function?
